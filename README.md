OVERVIEW
========

pgchronos are sql functions and operators for Postgresql for performing union, intersection, and difference operations on sets of daterange and tstzrange types.

As an example of a difference operation, imagine a hotel where frequent customers can earn special member rates during most of the year, excluding holiday weeks.

    Select unnest(
        (select array_agg(range) from special_membership_ranges) -
        (select array_agg(range) from holiday_exclusion_ranges)) special_booking_ranges;

Version 1.0.1 was released tagged as "stable", which was incorrect. Version 1.x should be viewed as a conceptual demonstration of alpha quality; it is not suitable for production use. A mature version is under development in the version 2 branch of the source.

These functions were originally developed as part of the ChronosDB project.  That code became half-redundant when Postgres introduced range data types in version 9.2. This code is a fork that brings it current with the latest Postgres versions, and utilizes the native Postgres range data types.  The current project site is <https://github.com/worden341/pgchronos>.


REQUIREMENTS
============

pgchronos utilizes the range datatypes introduced in Postgresql 9.2, therefore that is the minimum version you can use with this extension.


INSTALLATION
============

Copy all pgchronos* files to Postgresql's extension directory; on Debian, that is /usr/share/postgresql/<version>/extension.  Then execute "CREATE EXTENSION pgchronos;".  After installation, you may choose to run the included test script tests_run.sql.
